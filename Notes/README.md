Notes
-
The text files here are notes that I will be collecting regarding
- The behavior of Genesis
- Usage of various URL parameters
- Parsing tips
- Understanding of values returned by Genesis

Please be aware that I do make assumptions in these notes, some of which may not be true (especially when working out parsing strategies). However, many will also come purely from extensive tinkering and will be more reliable (ie URL parameters).

Each file has a name that corresponds to its contents, as well as a header within that explains the file's purpose.
